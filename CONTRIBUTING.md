## Tiles information / recommendation
A tile is a bunch of JSON data in the `./data/tiles.json` file.

:bulb: **Heads up:** In order to serve your local copy of `tiles.json` you will have to use `npm run local`, while `npm run dev` will serve remote JSON data from  [github](https://github.com/ponsfrilus/EPFLArrival/blob/master/data/tiles.json).

For example, the "GO" tile contains:
```
{
  "title":"GO",
  "desc_fr":"Service de raccourcissement d'URLs",
  "desc_en":"URLs shortener service",
  "link":"http://go.epfl.ch",
  "tags":[
    "service",
    "url",
    "website",
    "go"
  ],
  "maincat":[
    "service",
    "communication"
  ]
}
```

  * `title` is a short title to name the tile;
  * `desc_fr` a hook/brief/short sentence describing the tile (in French);
  * `desc_en` a hook/brief/short sentence describing the tile (in English);
  * `link` the link URL (in English) of the tile (No trailing "/" !);
  * `tags` the look-up table for the filter;
  * `maincat` the color and radio filter. Choose between [ "others", "service", "communication", "identity", "backup"] where:  
    - `service` is for services as help desk or reprography;
    - `communication` is for all tools to communicate as email, "UC";
    - `identity` is for IAM (identity and access management) or "me@EPFL";
    - `backup` for any plate-form to store or share data, as "my" or "gDrive";
    - `others` (and until more precise categories are defined), for everything else.

  Note that more than one category is allowed but color will only match the first one (consider the first one as the most important one).
